        <h3>In High School</h3>
        <p>As I mentioned, I was on the tennis team when
            I was in high school. I felt very confident
            about it and loved being on that team. I played
            doubles, so I had a partner that I would play 
            with and we were on the same team together for 3
            years, my sophomore, junior, and senior year. My 
            last year, we made it to the finals in our league
            but didn't win. Our record was 12-3, meaning we won 
            12 games and only lost 3. I also played field hockey
            briefly in high school but I didn't care that much 
            about it and quit my senior year because I was very sick
            from lyme disease.

        <h3>Since then</h3>
        <p>
            Since high school, I have not really been engaged
            in a structured sports team. I'm a little sad about
            that, as I loved being on a sports team and miss that
            aspect of life a lot, along with the fact that exercising
            can really make you feel better about life and things
            as it's important to get your body moving to help your 
            mind. This semester, I decided I needed to start making
            time to move my body and I joined intramural pickleball 
            and volleyball with some of my friends. I was really 
            anxious about volleyball but it has been super fun and
            getting some exercise has felt really nice for me!
