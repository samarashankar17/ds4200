            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Samara Shankar and I'm a second
                year studying data science and economics with 
                a minor in Law and Public Policy. I like to go 
                outside to hike as I really enjoy the great outdoors!
                I also like to spend time with my friends and my 
                girlfriend, doing things like watching tv or getting 
                boba. I really enjoy doing arts and crafts for fun,
                and participate in studio art club and mural club with
                one of my roommates. 
                <br>

                I recently got into running. I was not a big runner
                in high school even though I was an athlete (I played
                on the tennis team), and since coming to college have
                basically not exercised at all besides being on an
                intramural pickleball team with my friend Charlie. I 
                always thought that I was terrible at running because 
                I wasn't very fast, but my girlfriend had me run a mile
                with her the other day, and I realized that it's actually
                not that hard to run a mile, because you don't need to
                always go fast! We ran about a 10 minute mile, which is
                obviously bad, but I wasn't that tired and realized I do
                have some stamina in running. This inspired me to get 
                sneakers and start running, and my current goal is to do
                a 10K by January.
